Why the name?
=============

DV just wants to be able to say 

  "Hello I'm Daniel Veillard and I pronounce Sabayon 'Sa-ba-yon'"

Something about french food too. Something about egg yolks and wine.

Dependencies
============

For the GConf module you need GConf2-2.8.1-2 and gnome-python2-2.6.0-5
from rawhide.
You also need libxml2-python for XML parsing.
And the very recent gamin-python bindings for file monitoring

You'll also need to put

  include "$(HOME)/.gconf.path.mandatory"

in $(sysconfdir)/gconf/2/local-madatory.path and put

  include "$(HOME)/.gconf.path.defaults"

in $(sysconfdir)/gconf/2/local-defaults.path.
