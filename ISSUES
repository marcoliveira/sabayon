   Those are issues we need feedback on:

- should we use a single user (sabayon) with a fixed directory (/var/sabayon)
  and limit the tool to a single running instance or generate 
  users on the fly with temporary directories ?
- should we keep the ZIP based packaging format or just a directory
  with the same files as in the ZIP ? 
    + One bad point about using ZIP is that it doesn't retain file permissions
- wrapper scripts -  they make it easy to run stuff from the build directory
  but could be exploited since they try and run the script from the current
  directory
