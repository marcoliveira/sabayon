 - Don't use gnome-vfs for monitors, but use gamin directly

 - Higher level semantics for some changes - "e.g. clock applet added" -
   done now, but need to figure out how these types of changes get
   committed and applied.

 - Summary view idea

 - Filter out un-interesting changes

 - Instead of commit/save - allow admins to mark things as "ignore"

 - Implement the "run a session as test user with tool running inside it"
   part

 - Firefox and OpenOffice backends

 - Assigning a profile to users

 - Inheriting profiles from one another
