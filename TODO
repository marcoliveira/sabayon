 - Higher level semantics for some changes - "e.g. clock applet added" -
   done now, but need to figure out how these types of changes get
   committed and applied.

 - Summary view idea

 - Filter out un-interesting changes

 - Instead of commit/save - allow admins to mark things as "ignore"

 - Firefox backend needs save/apply support

 - OpenOffice backend

 - Assigning a profile to users

 - Inheriting profiles from one another

 - man page and docs

 - use xinclude in the docs or xslt to avoid repeating the download/contact
   info

 - static vs. dynamic users, and multiple instances of the tool
